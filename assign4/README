I had a very hard time with this program. I could explain it out loud but
when going to program it I would get lost. I chugged through for a long
time but then about thirty minutes ago when trying to unarchive a file
I tared earlier, I forgot it was a copy of mytar.c and it deleted my 
whole file that I was working on. So that was my fault for being 
careless and I take the blame. It was nothing I deserve any pity for.
This I hope works for unarchiving some files and copies the data to them
correctly. Beyond that I can't promise anything.
